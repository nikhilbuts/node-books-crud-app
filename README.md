### Setup and Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

```
    https://github.com/nikhilbuts/node-books-crud-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
    cd node-books-crud-app
    npm install
```

3. Set up MongoDB:
- Create a MongoDB database and configure the connection URI in .env file.
- You can use a cloud solution like MongoDB Atlas or set up a local MongoDB instance.

4. Set environment variables:
- Create a .env file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

5. Start the server:
```
    npm start || node app.js
```

6. Please access the API at http://localhost:3000.


### Decisions and Assumptions

- I assumed a basic authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user registration and login. You can extend this for more advanced user management.
- The API includes pagination and search functionality for listing books.
- I used Express.js for building the API and Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB database.
